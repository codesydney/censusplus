# Census+

[Please click to see the demo](http://www.censusplus.com.au/)

Main repository for Census+ Project. Census+ is basically obtaining all census information about an address. 'plus' means we will try to gather more open data on top of census data to gain further insights. We just focus on NSW open data at this stage. Possible use cases are market segmentation, property research, risk rating, government resource allocation and others.
